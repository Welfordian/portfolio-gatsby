So many blog posts and opinionated pieces on the internet (and in press) are taken as &#8220;factual&#8221; or not opinionated.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since I had the ability to vote (in the United Kingdom), I can remember voting <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)\" target=\"_blank\">conservative</a> (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tories_(British_political_party)\" target=\"_blank\">Tory</a>). The promises coming from the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)\" target=\"_blank\">Labor Party</a> always seemed too good to be true, ignorant to economics and, in general, wishful thinking (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/175749/Labour-There-s-no-money-left-in-Treasury\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there is no money&#8221;</a>). I have never, however, associated myself with the far-right parties (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Party\" target=\"_blank\">BNP</a>/<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party\" target=\"_blank\">UKIP</a>). Politics in the United Kingdom had never seemed to me to be quite as polarized as it is here in the United States. Though, when I moved to the US I found myself aligning more with the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)\" target=\"_blank\">Democratic Party</a>. Perhaps that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s no middle ground here. You either vote Democrat or you vote <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)\" target=\"_blank\">Republican</a>. There are, of course, Independent candidates that individuals can vote for, but those are considered a wasted vote in the United States. Contrary to popular belief, there are other political parties in the United States, but they are not considered a &#8220;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_States#Major_parties\" target=\"_blank\">Major Party</a>&#8220;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, remaining with the fact that there are only two major political parties in the United States, voters here are forced to choose between the better of two evils, for the most part. Though, saying &#8220;two evils&#8221; is a little too far, I believe. Society cannot run on the beliefs of a single political party. We have seen societies that fully incorporate a one-sided belief system and, though there are people out there who wish this not to be true, they all have failed miserably (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong\" target=\"_blank\">Mao Zedong</a>/<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\" target=\"_blank\">Adolf Hitler</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past year has been an interesting one, for me, politically. After my ex-wife and I decided that divorce was the best option for the both of us, I found that I had more free time to myself and, at some point, decided that I was interested in psychology. I had done reading on the topic and, eventually, found myself looking at videos on YouTube. After some time, I eventually found my way to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jordan Peterson</a>. Now, many people attribute Jordan Peterson to the &#8220;radical alt-right&#8221; in the same way that they attribute <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ben Shapiro</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Walsh_(political_commentator)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Matt Walsh</a> to the &#8220;radical alt-right&#8221;. Interestingly enough, though I certainly don&#8217;t agree with their views entirely. But I somehow found myself aligning my beliefs with theirs. It was certainly a shell-shock moment for me. Now, look, there are certainly beliefs that these people hold highly that I would never agree with. I won&#8217;t get into specifics at this time. But, Jordan Peterson has, himself, said many times that he doesn&#8217;t associate himself with the right but that he is, instead, a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism\" target=\"_blank\">Libertarian</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video that got me interested in learning more about Jordan Peterson was the one in which he sat with Cathy Newman and talked about why it&#8217;s important for men to &#8220;grow up&#8221;, the gender pay gap &amp; postmodernism. If you haven&#8217;t watched that video, which I recommend you do (even if you already don&#8217;t agree with Jordan Peterson&#8217;s view), you can watch it below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 flex flex-col items-center justify-center wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Jordan Peterson debate on the gender pay gap, campus protests and postmodernism\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMcjxSThD54?start=4&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Channel 4 Newsâ€™ full, fiery interview with clinical psychologist and professor Jordan B Peterson, whose views on gender have amassed great controversy &#8211; and a huge online following.

The ability to listen to one another without being so personally offended by the point-of-view of other people is something that, at least here in the United States, people seem to be losing. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, having a debate with someone is completely different, but debate doesn&#8217;t include screaming at each other about how the other person&#8217;s point of view is somehow &#8220;incorrect&#8221; or &#8220;out of touch&#8221; (or screaming at each other in general).</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://wp.welford.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/christian-lue-7dEyTJ7-8os-unsplash-1.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0OA=="}},
